## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in **AI Agent Automation** a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This project is built by developers, for developers, and values respectful, thoughtful, and technically honest collaboration.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct.

Unacceptable behavior may result in one or more of the following actions:

* A private warning
* Temporary or permanent removal from the community
* Rejection or reversal of contributions

Enforcement decisions are made to protect the health, safety, and integrity of the project — not to punish or shame individuals.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

* Do **not** escalate the situation publicly
* Contact the project maintainer directly via a private channel (GitHub profile contact or listed project email)

All reports will be reviewed discreetly, fairly, and in good faith. The project commits to protecting reporters from retaliation.

---

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers may consider the following when responding to incidents:

* The severity and impact of the behavior
* Whether the behavior was repeated or isolated
* The intent versus the effect of the behavior

Responses will be proportional and focused on maintaining a healthy, productive community.

---

## Philosophy

This project values:

* Technical clarity over ego
* Deterministic systems over hype
* Honest discussion over marketing language
* Collaboration over competition

Healthy disagreement is welcome. Disrespect is not.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant and customized to fit a developer-focused, open-source infrastructure project.
